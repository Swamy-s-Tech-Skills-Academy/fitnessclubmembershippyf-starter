## üöÄ **PRE-SPRINT SETUP** (5 minutes)

### **Environment Setup Prompt:**

```text
Set up a Flask development environment for a fitness club membership system:

1. Create virtual environment (.venv)
2. Install Flask==3.0.0, Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.1.1, Werkzeug==3.0.1
3. Create project structure: src/, tests/, docs/, src/templates/, src/static/, src/instance/
4. Create requirements.txt with dependencies
5. Activate virtual environment and install packages

Commands:
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install Flask==3.0.0 Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.1.1 Werkzeug==3.0.1
```

**Validation:** Virtual environment active, dependencies installed, folders created

## üèóÔ∏è **SPRINT 1: BACKEND FOUNDATION** (15 minutes)

### **Backend Development Prompt:**

```text
Build a complete Flask backend for a fitness club membership system with SQLAlchemy models:

MODELS TO CREATE:
1. Member (id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, date_of_birth, gender, emergency_contact, emergency_phone, join_date, status)
2. MembershipPlan (id, name, description, monthly_price, benefits)
3. Trainer (id, name, specialization, email, phone)
4. WorkoutSession (id, title, description, trainer_id, session_date, start_time, end_time, max_capacity, current_bookings)
5. MemberPlan (id, member_id, plan_id, start_date, end_date, status)
6. SessionBooking (id, member_id, session_id, booking_date, status)

FILES TO CREATE:
- src/config.py (Flask configuration with SQLite database)
- src/models.py (SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships)
- src/app.py (Flask app with routes: /, /members, /members/create, /members/<id>, /plans, /sessions, /sessions/schedule)
- src/init_db.py (database initialization with sample data)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use SQLite database: src/instance/fitness_club.db
- Include proper foreign key relationships
- Add comprehensive sample data: 3+ members, 3+ plans, 3+ trainers, 3+ sessions
- All routes should return JSON for now (templates come in Sprint 2)
- Include database statistics route for dashboard
```

**Validation:**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
cd src
python init_db.py
python app.py
# Visit http://localhost:5000 - should show JSON data
```

## üé® **SPRINT 2: FRONTEND TEMPLATES** (15 minutes)

### **Frontend Development Prompt:**

```text
Create a complete responsive frontend using Tailwind CSS for the Flask fitness club system:

TEMPLATES TO CREATE:
1. templates/base.html - Main layout with Tailwind CDN, responsive navigation, footer
2. templates/index.html - Dashboard with 8 analytics cards (members, sessions, revenue, growth)
3. templates/members/list.html - Member list with search, status badges, export button
4. templates/members/create.html - Member registration form with validation styling
5. templates/members/detail.html - Member profile with plan information
6. templates/plans/list.html - Membership plans with pricing cards
7. templates/sessions/list.html - Session list with booking functionality
8. templates/sessions/schedule.html - Session scheduling form

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Tailwind CSS CDN: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com
- Blue/gray professional color scheme
- Mobile-responsive design with hamburger menu
- Form validation styling and error messages
- Data tables with hover effects
- Cards layout for dashboard and plans
- Status badges and action buttons
- Professional typography and spacing

UPDATE FLASK ROUTES:
- Modify all routes in app.py to render templates instead of returning JSON
- Add proper template context data
- Include flash message support for user feedback
```

**Validation:**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
cd src
python app.py
# Visit http://localhost:5000 - should show styled dashboard
# Test all pages load correctly with proper styling
```
