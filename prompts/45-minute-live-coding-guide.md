## üé§ **PRESENTATION TIPS**

### **Energy & Engagement:**

- **Keep energy high** - this is meant to be exciting!
- **Engage audience** - ask "What do you think happens next?"
- **Show, don't just tell** - demonstrate each feature
- **Handle questions** - but defer detailed ones to after demo

### **Technical Tips:**

- **Use large font sizes** - everyone should see the code clearly
- **Explain the magic** - point out what the AI is doing automatically
- **Show real business value** - relate features to actual gym operations
- **Highlight best practices** - mention why we make certain choices

### **Timing Management:**

- **Watch the clock** - each phase has strict timing
- **Skip details if behind** - focus on working demo
- **Have backup plan** - pre-built version if needed
- **End with impact** - show the complete working system

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Issues During Live Demo:**

**Setup Issues:**

- **Virtual environment fails**: Use `python3 -m venv .venv` on some systems
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows)
- **Python not found**: Verify Python is in PATH

**Backend Issues:**

- **Import errors**: Double-check virtual environment is activated
- **Database errors**: Delete `instance/fitness_club.db` and re-run `init_db.py`
- **Port 5000 busy**: Use `python app.py --port 5001` or kill existing processes

**Frontend Issues:**

- **Tailwind not loading**: Check internet connection for CDN
- **Templates not found**: Verify `src/templates/` structure
- **Styling broken**: Clear browser cache

**Integration Issues:**

- **Forms not submitting**: Check Flask route methods (GET/POST)
- **CSV export fails**: Verify file permissions in project directory
- **AJAX not working**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### **Emergency Backup Plan:**

If live coding fails, have a pre-built version ready:

1. Clone the completed repository
2. Show the working application
3. Walk through the code structure
4. Emphasize the recreation process using prompts
