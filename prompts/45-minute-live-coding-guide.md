## 🎤 **PRESENTATION TIPS**

### **Energy & Engagement:**

- **Keep energy high** - this is meant to be exciting!
- **Engage audience** - ask "What do you think happens next?"
- **Show, don't just tell** - demonstrate each feature
- **Handle questions** - but defer detailed ones to after demo

### **Technical Tips:**

- **Use large font sizes** - everyone should see the code clearly
- **Explain the magic** - point out what the AI is doing automatically
- **Show real business value** - relate features to actual gym operations
- **Highlight best practices** - mention why we make certain choices

### **Timing Management:**

- **Watch the clock** - each phase has strict timing
- **Skip details if behind** - focus on working demo
- **Have backup plan** - pre-built version if needed
- **End with impact** - show the complete working system

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Issues During Live Demo:**

**Setup Issues:**

- **Virtual environment fails**: Use `python3 -m venv .venv` on some systems
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows)
- **Python not found**: Verify Python is in PATH

**Backend Issues:**

- **Import errors**: Double-check virtual environment is activated
- **Database errors**: Delete `instance/fitness_club.db` and re-run `init_db.py`
- **Port 5000 busy**: Use `python app.py --port 5001` or kill existing processes

**Frontend Issues:**

- **CDN resources not loading**: Check internet connection for external CSS/JS
- **Templates not found**: Verify `src/templates/` structure
- **Styling broken**: Clear browser cache

**Integration Issues:**

- **Forms not submitting**: Check Flask route methods (GET/POST)
- **CSV export fails**: Verify file permissions in project directory
- **AJAX not working**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### **Emergency Backup Plan:**

If live coding fails, have a pre-built version ready:

1. Clone the completed repository
2. Show the working application
3. Walk through the code structure
4. Emphasize the recreation process using prompts

## 🎯 **CLOSING (3 minutes) - Total: 55 min**

### **Demo the Complete System:**

1. **Member Management**: Add, search, edit members
2. **Session Booking**: Schedule and book sessions
3. **Analytics**: Show business metrics
4. **Export**: Download CSV data
5. **Mobile**: Show responsive design

### **Key Messages:**

- "We built a production-ready system in 45 minutes"
- "The prompts in this project let anyone recreate this"
- "This demonstrates the power of modern development tools"
- "You can use this approach for your own projects"

### **Next Steps for Audience:**

- "Try the prompts yourself"
