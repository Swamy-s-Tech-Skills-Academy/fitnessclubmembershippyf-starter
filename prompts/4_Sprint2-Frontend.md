FAVICON FILE CREATION:
Create a fitness-themed favicon for the application:

1. Generate a fitness club favicon (dumbbell, gym, or fitness icon)
2. Create multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, and 180x180 pixels
3. Save as both ICO and PNG formats in src\static\ folder:

```powershell
# PowerShell commands to create favicon files in src\static\
# Note: Use actual favicon generation tool or copy existing fitness-themed favicons

# Create a simple fitness-themed favicon using Font Awesome dumbbell icon concept
# Place these files in src\static\ folder:
# - favicon.ico (standard ICO format with multiple sizes)
# - favicon-32x32.png (32x32 PNG version)
# - favicon-16x16.png (16x16 PNG version)
# - apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 for iOS devices)

# If favicon already exists in docs\icons\, copy it:
Copy-Item "..\..\docs\icons\favicon.ico" "src\static\favicon.ico"
```
