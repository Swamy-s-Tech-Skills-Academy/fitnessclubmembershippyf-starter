# üé® Sprint 2: Members & Plans Management UI (15 minutes)

## üéØ **COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR SPRINT 2**

```text
Create Members & Plans Management UI interfaces for the fitness club system using modern responsive design:

SPRINT 2 FOCUS: MEMBERS & PLANS MANAGEMENT UI
- A. Update navigation component to activate Members and Plans links
- B. Build comprehensive CRUD interfaces for members management
- C. Create membership plans management with pricing displays
- D. Add professional forms with validation and user feedback
- E. Implement data tables with search, filtering, and export capabilities
- Focus on user-friendly interfaces for staff to manage members and plans

NAVIGATION COMPONENT UPDATE REQUIRED:
Before creating templates, update src\templates\_navbar.html:
1. Change Members link from href="#" to href="{{ url_for('members_list') }}"
2. Change Plans link from href="#" to href="{{ url_for('plans_list') }}"
3. Add proper active state highlighting for Members and Plans pages
This ensures navigation works properly when Members/Plans pages are created.

TEMPLATES NEEDED:
1. members/list.html - Member list with search, filters, pagination, and export
2. members/create.html - Member registration form with plan selection
3. members/detail.html - Member profile with plan history and session bookings
4. members/edit.html - Member edit form with status and plan management
5. plans/list.html - Membership plans display with pricing cards and features
6. plans/create.html - Create new membership plan form
7. plans/edit.html - Edit existing membership plan
8. plans/detail.html - Plan details with member count and revenue analytics

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- All templates MUST extend base.html (component-based architecture from Pre-Sprint)
- Use shared navigation component (_navbar.html) and footer component (_footer.html)
- Implement professional forms with Flask-WTF integration
- Include comprehensive error handling and success messages
- Add data export functionality (CSV) for members and plans
- Professional styling with existing Tailwind CSS theme
- DO NOT create monolithic templates - use the established component system

FEATURES TO INCLUDE:
- Member management: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- Plan management: Pricing displays, feature lists, member assignments
- Advanced search and filtering for member lists
- Data export capabilities (CSV format)
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Professional data tables with sorting and pagination
- Mobile-responsive design for all interfaces
- Integration with existing Sprint 1 dashboard navigation using shared _navbar.html component

All forms should connect to Sprint 1 API routes for data operations
Include proper error handling and user feedback throughout
