- `/api/plans` - REST API for membership plans
- `/sessions` - Workout session management

#### 2. Database Models ✅

**File:** `src/models.py`

**Models Implemented:**

```python
# Member Model
class Member(db.Model):
    - Personal information (name, email, phone, DOB)
    - Emergency contact details
    - Membership status tracking
    - Join date and timestamps
    - Age calculation property
    - Full name property

# Membership Plan Model
